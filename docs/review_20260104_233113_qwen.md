I can't access files outside the project directory, as the file `/tmp/tmppz78pi17.txt` is not within the `/home/kench/workspace/cospec` project folder. The tools I have available can only read files within the current project directory.

Would you like to share the content of that file with me by pasting it here, or perhaps move the file into the project directory if it's relevant to our work?
