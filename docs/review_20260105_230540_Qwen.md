I can't access files outside the project directory as specified in the system rules. The file `/tmp/tmpgc1roixl.txt` is not within the `/home/kench/workspace/cospec` project directory that we're working in.

Is there something specific you'd like me to help you with regarding the content of that file? If it's relevant to our work in the cospec project, perhaps you could share the content directly in our conversation or copy it into the project directory first.
